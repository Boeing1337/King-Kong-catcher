Main.java is my first project in learnig Java;
Main.java can encrypt and decrypt data from file or from command line while start the programm and save a result or print him in console;

-data "your string"          - to process string from console  
-in "path to input file"     - if you want to process data from file

-out "path to output file"   - to choose output file(rewrite) 

-mode enc or dec             - choose mode encrypt or decrypt 
-key integer                 - keycode

-alg unicode or shift        - choose algorithm unicode: all sumbvols be replased shift:only english letters will be replased
